#  UNCOMMENT ONE OF THE FOLLOWING "CAPTION" LINES, IF DESIRED
#  To learn how to write the caption codes, see the "STRING ESCAPES" section of the screen man page.
#
#
#  **List window titles & numbers along the bottom, the current one is bold turquoise.
#    Date & time on bottom-right, 20 spaces over from the right-edge.
#
#  Explanation:
#  Set the color and formatting for the non-current windows:  %{= .w}
#  Show the windows up until the current window, truncating as necessary: %-Lw
#  More truncation:  %20L>
#  Set the color and formatting for the current window: %{=b .g}
#  Show the current window's number and title, with "flags of the window" code: %n%f %t%
#  As  a special case, "%{-}" restores the attributes and colors that were set before the last change was made (from man page)
#  List the windows that are numbered higher than the current window:  %+Lw
#  Date and time on the right:  %-020= %D %d %M - %c
#  caption always "%{= .w}%-Lw%20L>%{=b .c}%n%f %t%{-}%+Lw %-020= %D %d %M - %c"
#
#
#  **The same as above, WITHOUT the date and time on the right
#    (when the time changes while you are doing Ctrl-PgUp, it drops you back down to the bottom)
#    And WITH the current window in GREEN
#    Also, remove the "flags of the window" code  (%f)
  caption always "%{= .w}%-Lw%20L>%{=b .g}%n %t%{-}%+Lw"

#
#  **Grey bar along the bottom with windows listed horizontally by title & number.
#  Hightlight the current window with blue.
#  caption always "%{kW}%?%-Lw%?%{bw}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%{kW}%?%+Lw%? %= %{= Wk}%110`%109`%122`%111`"
#
#
#  **Grey bar long bottom, current window number & title is only one listed in bottom-left.
#  Time is listed in bottom-right.
#  caption always "%3n %t%? @%u%?%? [%h]%?%=%c"
#
#
#
#  **The statusbar's features include:
#     -Host name at the left end. (bold if active split region)
#     -Date and time (mm-dd HH:MM) at the right end. (bold if active split region)
#     -Window numbers, status chars and names in the middle;
#        if there's not enough space, the list is abbreviated at the left and/or
#        right end in such a way that the host name, date/time and current window
#        are always visible. The current window is displayed in bold.
#  caption always '%?%F%{!b}%?%H%?%F%{-}%?|%0L=%-Lw%{!b}%50L>%n*%f %t%{-}%+Lw%-12=|%?%F%{!b}%?%m-%d %0c%?%F%{-}%?'

#
#  **Not sure how this one looks:
#   caption always '%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}][%= %{= kw}%?%-Lw%?%{r}(%{W}%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?%{r})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{g}][%{B} %d/%m %{W}%c %{g}]'
#
#
#
#  **Not sure how this one looks:
#   caption always '%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{r}(%{W}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%{r})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{g}][%{B}
%Y-%m-%d %{W}%c %{g}]'
#
#
#  **Not sure how this one looks:
#   caption always "%{= wb}$USER @ %H >> %-Lw%{= r}%50>%n* %t%{-}%+Lw%< %-=<< (%c.%s)"
#
#  **Not sure how this one looks:
#   caption always "%{= kG}%H [%Y%m%d %c]: %-Lw%{= bW}%50<%n%f* %t%{-}%+Lw%>"

#   Note the embeded space after the colon, I feel
#    it just looks nicer with a blank between the
#    text and console edge:
#     '%{=b}%{G} Screens: '
#
#   This prints the window listing in blue:
#     '%{b}%w'
#
#   This right-aligns what follows:
#     '%='
#
#   This displays the time (hours and minutes) in 12hr format
#   and adds an AM/PM flag, in bold green:
#     '%{G}%C%A'
#
#   This displays the day of the week:
#     '%D'
#
#   This displays the date in Mon/day/year format:
#   and again I embeded a space to give me one space
#   between the text and console edge:
#     '%M/%d/%Y '
#
#   The resultsing command give you a status line that
#       looks like this:
#    | Screens: 0* bash  <blanks zapped>         5:30PM  Fri, Jun/25/2004 |
#
#       (The pipes indicate the edges of the xterm/console).
#
# Green text, time, and date; windows in blue:
#  hardstatus alwayslastline "%{=b}%{G} Screen(s): %{b}%w %=%{kG}%C%A  %D, %M/%d/%Y "
