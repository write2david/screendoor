INTRODUCTION 

It is so nice to be able to login directly at my computer, or SSH, or open an xterm, etc and always be placed inside a pre-existing screen session, able to access all my other screen windows.

My code is not formatted the best.   I have a fair amount of comments along the way in each file, detailing the screen-related issues for dealing with logins that happen in situations like SCP and x-ming, and if x-windows is running from within screen and then you open a xterm w/in that, etc.

Took me lots of trial and error, am open to any input for improving those files.   They do work great currently.

The main screen session is "Cornerstone" (with one blank, non-writable window, has a message giving its purpose, and is held open with a long "sleep" command) and windows are titled by date & time.   In case two logins happen during the same minute or second, milliseconds is also used in the window name,  in order to make sure each window name is unique.




USE
Begin using screendoor.sh by adding a line like this to the end of a file like .bash_login and .bashrc

. [path to screendoor]/screendoor.sh

For example:
. ~/screendoor.sh




TIPS

May be good to put something like this in your .screenrc

defscrollback 10000
# Window tabs, second to last line
# caption always "%{kW}%?%-Lw%?%{bw}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%{kW}%?%+Lw%? %= %{= Wk}%110`%109`%122`%111`"
caption always "%{= .w}%-Lw%20L>%{=b .c}%n%f %t%{-}%+Lw %-020= %D %d %M - %c"
