INTRODUCTION TO SCREENDOOR

It is so nice to be able to login at my computer (directly, or over SSH, or opening an xterm/Terminal window, etc.) and always be placed inside a pre-existing screen session, able to access all other open terminals.
        This also lets you disconnect from your SSH (perhaps using Putty) connection and the program remains running.


The code contains a fair amount of comments along the way in each file, detailing the screen-related issues for dealing with logins that happen in situations like SCP and xMing, and if x-windows is running from within screen and then you open a xterm w/in that, etc.

When using Screendoor, the main Screen session is named "main," created upon the first login/shell.  New windows are titled by date & time.  The "main" session contains a window named "Cornerstone" to hold it open (it is a blank, non-writable window, giving a short message, and is held open with a long "sleep" command).
	In case two logins happen during the same minute or second, milliseconds is also used in the window name,  in order to make sure each window name is unique.



USING SCREENDOOR

There are 3 steps:

1) Use the included ".screenrc" file, or merge the (uncommented) lines with your own, pre-existing .screenrc file.

2) Put "screendoor.sh" in your home directory.

3) Add a line like the following to the END of your shell startup file(s)

	. ~/screendoor.sh


   For example, if BASH is your default shell, this line goes in BOTH your .bashrc AND your .bash_login files.
        Or, if using zsh, this line goes at the end of your .zshrc file.




TIPS

Clone this git repo, check it out, and then softlink your .bash_login (or .zshrc), .screenrc, etc to the checked-out repo (working directory).
