INTRODUCTION 

It is so nice to be able to login at my computer (directly, or over SSH, or opening an xterm/Terminal window, etc.) and always be placed inside a pre-existing screen session, able to access all other open terminals.
        This also lets you disconnect from your SSH (perhaps using Putty) connection and the program remains running.


My code is not formatted the best.   I have a fair amount of comments along the way in each file, detailing the screen-related issues for dealing with logins that happen in situations like SCP and x-ming, and if x-windows is running from within screen and then you open a xterm w/in that, etc.

Took me lots of trial and error, am open to any input for improving those files.   They do work great currently.

The main screen session is "Cornerstone" (with one blank, non-writable window, has a message giving its purpose, and is held open with a long "sleep" command) and windows are titled by date & time.   In case two logins happen during the same minute or second, milliseconds is also used in the window name,  in order to make sure each window name is unique.




USE
Begin using screendoor.sh by adding a line like this to the end of a file like .bash_login and .bashrc

. [path to screendoor]/screendoor.sh

For example:
. ~/screendoor.sh




TIPS

Clone this git repo, check it out, and then softlink your .bash_login, .screenrc, etc to the checked-out repo (working directory).
