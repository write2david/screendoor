TODO


1)  Does screendoor work fine when using it in a non-root account?

2)  With multiuser on, can non-root accounts connect to a screendoor session owned by root?


3)  Add the "Entering GNU Screen, press any key to cancel."  (from porch.sh)
	And, "You are now in GNU Screen (via screendoor)."
	And, if we detect that this is a login shell (SSH, virtual console (F1, F2, etc): "Press Ctrl-Up to view any login-related messages (such as SSH port-forwarding issues, etc)."  # Issue is that auto-running screen at login clears the screen and then you miss any login-related messages.  Perhaps see if removing the "clear" command from screendoor.sh fixes the problem.  Can't test this over SSH since "clear" does not affect with Putty the same way it does in-person.
	And similar for "Leaving GNU Screen."
	Comment them both out, and add a line "Uncomment to enable message."


4)  Possibly: Remove need for "Cornerstone" window, or make it optional and disabled (commented-out) by default.
	Cornerstone is mostly needed to ensure multiuser?  If so, this this line of screenrc, which can be overwritten:
	multiuser off      (or on)


5)  Copy/paste e-mail exchange into porch-note.txt


6)  Minor bug: cannot view messages dislayed during shutdown process, when using screendoor.
	Seems that the messages are sent to /dev/ttyS0.
	cat /dev/ttyS0   --  this will catch them and display them
	so maybe the "shutdown" command needs to be "shutdown && cat /dev/ttyS0"


	WAIT, this is actually normal behavior, I believe.
		The shutdown messages are visible when you are sitting at the terminal.
		But not when using GNU screen remotely over SSH.
