TODO

1)  Bug: When WinSCP logs in, it activates .bash_login, and the sourcing of screendoor prevents WinSCP login.

2)  Remove the call to zsh in the screendoor.sh file.

3)  Add the "Entering GNU Screen, press any key to cancel."  (from porch.sh)
	And similar for "Leaving GNU Screen."
	Comment them both out, and add a line "Uncomment to enable message."

4)  Remove need for "Cornerstone" window, or make it optional and disabled (commented-out) by default.

5)  Shorter window names (how?) so they line up better at the bottom.

6)  Copy/paste e-mail exchange into porch-note.txt

7)  Minor bug: cannot view messages dislayed during shutdown process, when using screendoor.
