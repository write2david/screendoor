TODO

1)  Add the "Entering GNU Screen, press any key to cancel."  (from porch.sh)
	And similar for "Leaving GNU Screen."
	Comment them both out, and add a line "Uncomment to enable message."

2)  Remove need for "Cornerstone" window.

3)  Shorter window names (how?) so they line up better at the bottom.

4)  Copy/paste e-mail exchange into porch-note.txt
